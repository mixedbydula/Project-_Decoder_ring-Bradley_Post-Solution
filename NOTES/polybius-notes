NOTES 2
In this example, the grid will be arranged as above and coordinates will be read by comparing the first digit to the number on the top of the table and the second digit to that on the left.

"thinkful" -> "4432423352125413"
When decoding the message, each pair of numbers is translated using the coordinates.

polybius()
The polybius() function in the src/polybius.js file has two parameters:

input refers to the inputted text to be encoded or decoded.
encode refers to whether you should encode or decode the message. By default it is set to true.
When building the function, keep the following constraints and rules in mind:

You are welcome to assume that no additional symbols will be included as part of the input. Only spaces and letters will be included.
When encoding, your output should still be a string.
When decoding, the number of characters in the string excluding spaces should be even. Otherwise, return false.
Spaces should be maintained throughout.
Capital letters can be ignored.
The letters I and J share a space. When encoding, both letters can be converted to 42, but when decoding, both letters should somehow be shown.
